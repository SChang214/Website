        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p> - Produced an assembly manual in SolidWorks Composer to guide streamlined assembly processes</p>
        <p> - Created drawings with dimensions and tolerances to aid in cross-team communication and effective presentations </p>
        <p> - Iteratively designed pieces using design-for-manufacturing principles and rapid prototyping to optimize for easy assembly and cost-effective and time-effective fabrication with the final print taking 4 hours and cost $4</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Reflection" class="container">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>In the initial prototypes we did not properly account for sagging of the filament in unsupported areas during the manufacturing process. Due to that, the pieces did not feel satisfying to put together and take apart. To fix this, some pieces were reprinted, while others were sanded down to fit. In future projects, I will remember to account for sagging before printing the first prototype.</p>
