        <h2> Engineering problem</h2>
        <p> - Two-users must be able to play checkers using one screen</p>
        <p> - Due to it's nature as an early career project, I did not have the opportunity to check as many edge-cases as I would have liked</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Classes" class="container">
        <h2> Classes</h2>
        <p> - Game.java : main java file</p>
        <p> - ButtonGrid.java : creates buttons and puts them in a window (GUI) </p>
        <p> - CheckersBoard.java : puts the buttons into a checkers format and does styling (GUI) </p>
        <p> - Matrix.java : matrix of booleans</p>
        <p> - Player.java : Tracks player moves. Checkers logic is implmented here</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Contributions" class="container">
        <h2> Contributions</h2>
        <p> -  Built a functional a 2-player checkers game, integrating win-state detection, board visualization, move validation and king promotion logic </p>
        <p> - Developed a button based checkers board GUI using java.swing to display the board in an intuitive fashion</p>
        <p> - Tracked checker stones and king states and positions using a matrix based system to manage board logic</p>
        <p> - Reduced code written by 50\% by implementing object oriented programming</p>
            
    </section>

    <section id="Reflection" class="container">
        <h2> Reflection</h2>
        <p> If future iterations were made, an effort should be made to clean up code and simplify logic used in coding.</p>
