        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p> -  Collaboratively and iteratively designed a low-cost mechanic exoskeleton hand which cost $10 to aid people with low hand strength using SolidWorks</p>
        <p> - Designed and modeled 1 degree of freedom joints in SolidWorks to optimize parts spacing. </p>
        <p> - Rapidly prototyped a pin locking mechanism in SolidWorks to provide external structural support for the hand</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results" class="container">
        <h2>Current status</h2>
        <p> -  The current prototype is mechanical based, in future iterations we are looking into incorporating servo motors into the design to make it more automated</p>
