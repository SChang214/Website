        <h1>Nothern Student-Led Arctic Research Project</h1>
        <p class = "tag">Research | 2023-2025</p>
        <p>Participated in research concerning the health of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="description" class="container">
        <p>Worked in a team supervised by Dr. Waterman, Dr. Roth and Dr. McKinnon from the University of Manitoba to analyse polar bear health and compare 3 methods to evaluate polar bear health.</p>
        <p>This analysis used the data of 88 bears.</p>
        <p>This is a long term project that comprises of more than 27 years of data which searches to unobtrusively monitor polar health in the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population.</p>

        <h2> Contributions</h2>
        <p> - Data review of years 1998 – 2019 as well as 2024</p>
        <p> - Used Whisker print technology to create a libarary for bears from 2024. Whisker printing  allows for bears to be identified over multiple years and prevents bears from being registered as different individuals as well as for tracking their health over multiple years. </p>
        <p> - Collected data in Churchill, Manitoba of 37 polar bears</p>
